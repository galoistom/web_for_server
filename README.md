This is my first webpage **>_<**

I run a minecraft server on my raspberrypi, and my friend want to restart server from time to time, but I do not want him to gain access to the hole machine, so I build this webpage. It is also a practice as I have been learning golang for a couple days. The front end is genreated by gemini as I bearly know how to write html. **QWQ**

I have build it for my pi, and if you want to use it, you'd better rewrite the shell script in order to start your server (might be more difficult if you are on windows).

Refresh the page by clicking buttons (because I'm lazy)

# Usage
Downloads the mainpack dirctionary, and put the right build for your system, and run it. Please make sure you have start the rcon service in server.property (settings can be changed to suit your need in config.json). Move the server file to ~/server/ and rename it to "server.jar" (or change the script "server.sh" if you like)

Or you can simply use the install script. Change the config file for the position for your server (however you shoud rename the jar file into server.jar)
