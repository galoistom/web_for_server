This is my first webpage **>_<**

I run a minecraft server on my raspberrypi, and my friend want to restart server from time to time, but I do not want him to gain access to the hole machine, so I build this webpage. It is also a practice as I have been learning golang for a couple days. The front end is genreated by gemini as I bearly know how to write html. **QWQ**

I have build it for my pi, and if you want to use it, you'd better rewrite the shell script in order to start your server (might be more difficult if you are on windows).

Refresh the page by clicking buttons (because I'm lazy)
